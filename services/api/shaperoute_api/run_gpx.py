"""A saved run as a GPX file with its times (TASK-187, ADR-0156,
docs/GPX.md).

Not the route's GPX, which the engine writes (export_gpx.py): that is a
line to follow, without times. This is where the runner was and when, as
`runs` keeps it: the file another service reads as an activity done. It is
written when it is sent and kept nowhere.

A pause closes a track segment and the next point opens another, as GPX
wants for a receiver switched off: what the runner did in a pause is not of
the run, so the points taken inside one are left out.
