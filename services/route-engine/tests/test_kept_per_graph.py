"""What the engine keeps per graph between traces (TASK-203, ADR-0162).

The corridor's steps and edge samples, the node ids and their coordinates
are worked out once per graph and kept while the graph stays as it is; a
trace no longer counts the edges of the graph to know it. The routes are
those of before, point for point: `BEFORE` pins them, as `main` at 3f905d7
planned them, before the change.
