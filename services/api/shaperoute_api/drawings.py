"""Drawings: the runs an account shows the other members (TASK-117,
TASK-208, docs/API.md, «Drawings»).

A run saved in My activities (activities.py) is private. Its owner may give
it a title, a description, the members it tags, up to three photos
(drawing_photos.py), and say who can see it (ADR-0170): every member, the
members who follow it with the request accepted (follows.py), or only
itself. The photos are kept here only while others can see the drawing:
while only its owner does, they stay on the phone (the user's choice,
2026-10-03).

What the others see is cut: the track without its first and its last
CUT_M metres along it, without times, without the planned route, which
begins at the runner's door (ADR-0114, point 4). The owner keeps the whole
run in My activities.

Who may see a drawing is asked in one place, drawing_seen_sql: the
drawing, its photos and its comments (TASK-120) follow it.

Score, metres and seconds are the run's, counted by the API when it was
saved: nothing here takes them from the app. Deleting the run, or the
account, deletes its drawing (ON DELETE CASCADE); deleting an account
tagged takes its name off the drawing.
