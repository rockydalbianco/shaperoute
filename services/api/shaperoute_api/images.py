"""Images (TASK-073, ADR-0069): the outline of a picture, for the app to
show before asking for a route, and the route of that outline.

The engine traces the outline (route_engine/image_outline.py, ADR-0068);
the API only carries it. The app sends the image once, in base64 inside
JSON, and gets the outline back; the route request then sends the outline,
not the image again. That outline comes from the phone, so it is checked
again like any input: its size, its numbers, and the engine's own check of
an outline (parse_outline).
