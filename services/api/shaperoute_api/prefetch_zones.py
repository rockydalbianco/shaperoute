"""Zones downloaded before anyone asks for them (TASK-137, ADR-0118).

For each city, the zone that serves "Explore" from its centre: the shape of
every theme at 10 km from any start the themed search may take (within
`search_radius_m` of the centre), and the city's examples, a 5 km heart,
circle and star from any start the engine may move them to (FAR_OFFSET_M).
A city whose zone is already in the cache is ready; the others are
downloaded one at a time, with their street names (ADR-0057), as MAPS.md
asks of Overpass: a pause between cities, one attempt each, and the first
failure stops the command. Run again, it goes on from the missing cities.
