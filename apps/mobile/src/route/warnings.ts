/**
 * The route engine's warnings in plain words (TASK-054).
 *
 * The engine writes them for developers: "shape similarity 0.85 is below 0.90
 * after 12 attempts". The contract has no codes for them yet, so the app
 * recognises the texts the engine writes today and says them simply. A text it
 * does not recognise is shown as it is, with a capital first letter: a new
 * warning is never hidden (ADR-0077).
 *
 * The patterns follow the engine's f-strings: `validation.py` (the Issues),
 * `optimizer.py` (search, plan_shape) and `network.py` (snap_to_network).
 * Codes in the contract would make this file unnecessary.
