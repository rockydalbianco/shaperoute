A running route is drawn on the foot network, a cycling route on the bike
network: each has its own cached zones (`foot_*`, `bike_*`), and the engine
refuses a graph of another network (`network.check_network`). The API keeps
one ZoneGraphs for each and gives a route the one of its activity. What has
no activity, the themed routes and the directions of a route of "Explore",
is on foot, as before. A paddling route has no network: it is drawn on the
water of the cache (paddling.ServerWater, TASK-191).
