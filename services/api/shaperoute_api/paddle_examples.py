"""The paddling examples of «Explore» that come with the app (TASK-227,
ADR-0189).

The user's choice: the examples of the places of «Explore» with «Paddle»
(the lakes and the beaches of the app's `waterPlaces.ts`) are in the app as
it is downloaded, not drawn on its first opening. This command draws them
with the engine, as the API would (`paddling.plan_water`), on the water of a
cache folder: the server's `data/cache/water/`, or a copy of it (TASK-225).
It writes them as the app keeps the examples it draws
(`exampleRoutes.ts`, `asRecommended`): for each place, under the key the app
looks it up by, its eight shapes whole.

    python -m shaperoute_api.paddle_examples --cache-dir out/water-cache

Nothing is downloaded: a place whose water is not in the folder stops the
command. The file changes with the places, the shapes and the engine; run
the app's Prettier on it after (`npx prettier --write <file>`).

The file says which engine drew it (`engine`): the fingerprint of the
engine's files a paddling route is drawn with (`route_engine.paddling` and
what it imports, followed through the `import` lines, and the outlines of
the eight shapes). When one of them changes, `tests/test_paddle_examples.py`
fails and says to run this command again, as the phone's engine zip does
(tools/phone_engine). The water comes from the server: `scp
'root@<server>:/root/shaperoute/data/cache/water/*.json' <cache>/water/`.
