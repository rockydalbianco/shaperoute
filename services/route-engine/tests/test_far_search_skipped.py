"""The far search starts only where nothing near the start can be drawn
(TASK-203 B, ADR-0230).

It used to start whenever the search near the start found no good route
(ADR-0040): half the time of a long request, and on fifteen requests in
six cities it gave a better route in one. Now a route near the start that
is drawable, good or not, keeps it out: the request is faster, and the
shape stays where the user is. Where nothing near can be drawn it runs as
before, and wins with any drawable route.
