"""Bike routes on the bike network (TASK-190 part A, ADR-0153).

No network: the Overpass answer is a small town made here, a grid of
streets with one-way rows, steps, a footway, a trunk road, a street closed
to bikes and a cycle path, which OSMnx turns into graphs as it does a real
answer. The foot network is the one of every other test.
