"""Blocking and reporting (TASK-121, ADR-0228, docs/API.md, «Block and
report»).

PUT /users/{public_id}/block keeps two members apart, both ways: neither
sees the other's drawings in the feed, comments, reactions, profile or name
in a search (follows.apart_sql, read by each of those modules). Blocking
also ends any follow and any request between the two, in both directions,
and a new request across the block is answered as for nobody. DELETE
unblocks; neither side is told. Both change nothing done again: a second
block keeps one, unblocking someone not blocked is done already.
GET /me/blocked lists the members blocked, the last first, to unblock them.

POST /reports keeps what a member reports, a drawing, a comment or a
member, with a reason from a short list: one row for each reporter and
thing, the latest reason kept. The reports stay in the table for whoever
runs the app; no endpoint reads them (no admin panel yet, ADR-0228).

Deleting an account deletes its blocks, both ways, and its reports
(ON DELETE CASCADE).
