"""A city's examples, drawn once and kept for whoever asks next.

In "Explore" every phone asks the same of a city: a heart, a circle and a
star of 5 km from its centre (exampleRoutes.ts). The engine draws the same
routes each time, some seconds each on the PC and many more on the server,
one after the other. Here a route drawn from a city's centre is kept in a
file, and the same request is answered from it at once, as a job already
done: only the first phone in a city waits.

Only from a city's centre. A request carries where the user is; keeping
every route is the user's choice of ADR-0086, and belongs to TASK-092, in
the database, with the rules on personal data still to write. Until then
the API keeps no one's position (ADR-0085, ADR-0092), and a city's centre is
no one's position. TASK-092 can take this over: RouteJobs calls `put` for
every route that ends, and here the ones from elsewhere are dropped.

The centres are those the API itself gave to GET /cities and GET
/city-suggestions, and a start is one of them when it falls in the same
square of about 10 m (4 decimals, as the app's `cityKey`). A route from
anywhere else is never written, and an image's outline neither.

The same request: the same shape or word, style, distance and activity, the
pen up or not, from the same centre, drawn by the same engine. A route is
drawn again after KEEP_S, for the roads that changed, and at once when the
engine's code is another: its fingerprint is part of the name of the file.

On the water (TASK-246 part B): the points of the app's lists of lakes and
beaches (water_spots.py) are centres too, given when the API starts. A
phone asks the eight shapes of the three points nearest it from the points
themselves, and a point of a list is no one's position. Their routes are in
a folder of their own with a limit of its own: the lists' eight shapes are
many more routes than the cities', and much lighter, and drawing them all
must not push a city's examples out.
