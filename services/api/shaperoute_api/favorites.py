"""Favorites: the routes an account keeps (TASK-171, ADR-0139,
docs/DATABASE.md).

A favorite is a copy of a route, whole: its line, what it draws, how long it
is. The app names it with a key made from the line, so the same route is one
favorite however it was reached, and keeping it twice changes nothing.

Every endpoint needs the token of an account (accounts.py): a favorite is
seen, kept and removed only by its owner. Deleting the account deletes its
favorites (ON DELETE CASCADE).

A favorite remembers the activity it was drawn for (TASK-200): a bike route
reopens as one. Those kept before are runs. A bike route also keeps where it
is walked with the bike on foot (TASK-206).
