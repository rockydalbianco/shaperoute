"""The feed: the drawings the members publish, read by whoever is signed in
(TASK-118, ADR-0227, docs/API.md, «Feed»).

A page of GET /feed holds the drawings the reader may see, in three
groups: its own first, then those of the people it follows, then the
others', which are the nearby ones when the phone says where it is
(within NEAR_M of the point) and all of them when it does not. Inside
each group the one published last comes first. No filter, no ranking
beyond this: the user's choice («ok va bene questo semplice»).

Who may see a drawing is the question of the profiles (drawings.shown_sql):
every member sees one for `everyone`, the followers with the request
accepted (follows.py) and the owner see one for `followers`, nobody
reads one for `only_me`, not even its owner: the feed holds what was
published, never a private run, and never a track that is not cut.

The pages follow a cursor made of the group, the moment of publication
and the random id of the last drawing of the page: a drawing published
between two pages goes to the top of its group, above the cursor, and
the next page neither repeats nor skips one. Every post is a Drawing as
the profile lists it (drawings.DrawingBody) with its author: the app
opens it whole with GET /drawings/{id}, with its reactions and comments.
