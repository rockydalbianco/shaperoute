"""The profile of an account (TASK-116, ADR-0128, docs/API.md, «Profile»).

PATCH /me changes the username and the bio of who sends it: the same rule
for the username as when signing up, unique whatever the case; a bio of at
most MAX_BIO_LENGTH characters. A value refused is told in words, for the
app to show as it is.

GET /users/{public_id} is the profile as every member sees it: username,
bio, picture (profile_photos.py), number of drawings published
(drawings.py), how many it follows and how many follow it, and where the one
who asks stands towards it (follows.py). Never the email, the role, the
internal id or when the account was made. It needs the token of an account:
what members share is for members, as the feed (ADR-0114, point 4). The id
is the random `public_id` of the account, not `id`: a sequence would let
anyone walk every profile and count the accounts. Between two members a
block keeps apart (TASK-121, moderation.py) it is 404, as for nobody.
