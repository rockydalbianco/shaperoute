"""Following, with a request the other accepts (TASK-211, ADR-0173,
docs/API.md, «Follow»).

A member finds another by name (GET /users?q=) and asks to follow; the
other accepts or declines. Only an accepted request counts: in the numbers
of a profile (profiles.py), in the lists, and for who may see a drawing
meant for the followers (follows_sql, TASK-208). Declining deletes the
request: the one who asked sees what it saw before asking, and nothing
says it was declined.

Every action leads to a state and changes nothing done again: asking twice
keeps one request, withdrawing what is not there is done already. Only
accepting with no request at all is 404.

Who follows whom is read only by its own account (GET /me/followers,
/me/following, /me/follow-requests): the others see the two numbers of a
profile. A list or a search gives the name, the public id and a small
picture of each member, never the email. Deleting an account deletes its
rows (ON DELETE CASCADE): it leaves every list and every number.

A block (TASK-121, moderation.py) ends every follow between the two and
keeps them apart: the search does not find the other, and asking to follow
across it is 404, as for nobody.
