"""Cities of the whole world by name, for "Explore" (TASK-129, ADR-0099).

GET /cities asks Geoapify's geocoding for cities only, with the key of the
place search (places.py). Not its autocomplete: for a city that one gives
the middle of the municipality's area, which for Milan is in Baggio, 6 km
from the Duomo; the geocoding of a city gives the city's own point, its
centre. Answers are kept a day: city centres do not move.

A place has one point, OpenStreetMap's own for it: its `place` node
(TASK-249, ADR-0213). The geocoding of a village may give its municipality
instead, an area whose point is the middle of it, 650 m from the church in
Tenna. For each such area the Places API is asked for the place with the
same label inside it, and that point is the city's: the one GET
/city-suggestions and GET /nearby-cities give for the same place. When the
Places API does not answer, the search still does, with the geocoding's
points, and that answer is not kept: the next search asks again.

GET /city-suggestions (TASK-134, TASK-138, ADR-0110) suggests cities and
places in them while typing: "arena di ver" gives the Arena di Verona.
