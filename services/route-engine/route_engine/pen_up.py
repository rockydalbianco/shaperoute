"""Words written with the pen up (TASK-197, ADR-0157).

A word asked with `pen_up` is the open line of `words.compose(pen_up=True)`:
each letter once, from its entry to its exit on the base line. Here it
becomes a route:

- every letter is traced on its own, as an open line (`snap_to_network`
  with `closed=False`), with the zones and the corridor of the whole drawing
  (`trace`);
- from the end of one letter to the start of the next the route takes the
  shortest way along the roads: a walk, with neither zones nor corridor,
  that the runner walks with the recording paused;
- the route is one line, letters and walks in order, and `walks` says
  which stretches of it are walked: [from, to] indices into its points,
  both included. Where a walk ends, the next letter begins.
- a piece of a shape that leaves its line for a long detour is drawn in
  parts, and the detour is walked too (detours.py, TASK-242); so is a spike
  of its outline (TASK-243).

Only the letters count: the similarity looks at them alone (`similarity`),
and the distance asked for is theirs (`drawn_m`). The route's own length,
`distance_m`, still counts every point, walks included.
