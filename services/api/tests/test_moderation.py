"""Blocking and reporting in a real PostgreSQL (TASK-121, ADR-0228): a block
keeps two members apart both ways, in the feed, the comments, the
reactions, the search, the follows and the profile; it ends every follow
between them; done twice or undone when not there it changes nothing. A
report is kept once for each reporter and thing. Deleting an account takes
its blocks and its reports."""
