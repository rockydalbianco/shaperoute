"""Send to Strava: a run done goes to the runner's Strava profile (TASK-187,
ADR-0156, docs/API.md).

An account connects its Strava athlete through the browser and this server
(OAuth, `activity:write` only): the app never sees the Client Secret or a
Strava token. A saved run is then uploaded as an activity: the GPX of its
track with the real times (run_gpx.py), `POST /uploads`. Strava reads the
file in a second or two; the API follows the upload and keeps on the run
what became of it, so a run sent twice is one activity.

Without this server's Strava application (strava_client.py) Strava is off:
GET /me/strava says `available: false` and the app shows nothing of it.

Nothing secret is logged or answered: not the Client Secret, not a token,
not a code, not a state.
