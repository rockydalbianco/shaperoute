"""The towns near a point, for "Near me" in "Explore" (TASK-236, ADR-0200).

GET /nearby-cities gives at most six places around where the user is. Four
are cities and towns: those within 20 km, the largest first; where there
are fewer than four, as around a city alone in its valley, the circle
widens up to 50 km and the nearest beyond fill the list. Two more are the
nearest of all within 20 km, villages too, however small (the user's
choice). The place the user is in is not one of them: "Near me" already
shows it.

They are OpenStreetMap's `place=city`, `place=town` and `place=village`,
through Geoapify's Places API with the key of the place search (places.py):
the same points and the same labels GET /cities gives for those names (a
village too, since TASK-249: a place's point is this one, ADR-0213), so a
town tapped here and the same town typed are one city, with the same
examples kept (route_store.py). The service is asked
from the middle of a square of about 1 km, not from the user's own
position, and the answer is kept a day.
