"""Comments: what the members write under a drawing (TASK-120, docs/API.md,
«Comments»).

Whoever can see a drawing (drawings.drawing_seen_sql) reads its comments
and writes one: its owner always, the others as its visibility says
(TASK-208). A drawing seen by fewer keeps them, unseen by the others, until
they see it again. A comment is deleted by who wrote it, or by the owner of
the drawing; deleting the drawing (with its run), or the account that wrote
it, deletes it too (ON DELETE CASCADE).

A comment is plain text: the API keeps it as written, the app shows it as
text, never as a link or as HTML (docs/UI.md). A negative one is never kept:
comment_filter.py says which (TASK-213, ADR-0176).

A block keeps two members apart (TASK-121, moderation.py): neither reads,
writes or counts the comments of the other, nor opens the other's drawing.
