"""Turn-by-turn directions at the junctions of a route (TASK-047, ADR-0045).

A direction is given where the route changes road at a junction, or takes
one of two ways ahead at a fork, not where the track changes heading. A
junction is a node with at least MIN_BRANCHES roads; on any other node
nothing is said, whatever the angle: the graph is simplified (OSMnx keeps a
road's bends in its edges), and the few nodes left with two roads are cut
borders or ways joined end to end.

Branches are counted on the roads, not with `graph.degree`: in a two-way
MultiDiGraph a node in the middle of a road has degree 4, two edges in and
two out, and would look like a junction.

Works in metres on the plane tangent at each node (route_engine.geo).
