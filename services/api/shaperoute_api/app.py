"""The HTTP API: RouteRequest in, RouteResult out (docs/API.md).

The API orchestrates and does not compute: the route comes from the engine's
plan_route, errors become a status and a code the app can explain. The app
uses route jobs (ADR-0032); POST /routes answers in one go, for /docs, curl
and measurements. POST /shape-readings asks the AI which shape of the
catalogue some words name (ADR-0012): the AI never sees the route.
