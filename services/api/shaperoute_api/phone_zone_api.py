"""GET /phone-zones/{network}: the cached zone around a point, as the phone
draws on it (TASK-214, ADR-0177).

The file is written once beside the zone (phone_zones.py) and again when the
zone is newer; its ETag lets the phone ask again and get 304. A point with no
cached zone around it is a 404: the server draws routes there until a route
asked of it downloads the zone. Nothing here downloads from Overpass.

A zone the phone downloads ahead, not the one around it, comes with
`?prefetch=1` and counts against the day's cap (phone_zone_cap.py, part A2):
beyond it, 429 with Retry-After.

`python -m shaperoute_api.phone_zone_api` writes the file of every cached
zone ahead, so no phone waits for it (with the user's OK, as draw_examples).
