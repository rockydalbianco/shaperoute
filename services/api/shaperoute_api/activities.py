"""My activities: the runs an account recorded (TASK-172, ADR-0140,
docs/DATABASE.md).

The app sends a run as it recorded it: the fixes, the pauses, and the route
it followed when there was one, with the walks of a word with the pen up
(TASK-199). The API keeps where the runner was (the
engine's cleaning of the track, ADR-0090) and counts metres, seconds and
score itself: the app's own numbers are never asked for. The app names the
run with a key made from its track, so a run sent twice is kept once.

Every endpoint needs the token of an account (accounts.py): a run is seen,
opened and deleted only by its owner. Deleting the account deletes its runs
(ON DELETE CASCADE). A run opened whole has its pauses as they are kept
(TASK-200). A run says what it was, on foot, by bike or paddling (TASK-208):
its drawing shows it, and Strava takes it (drawings.py, strava.py).
