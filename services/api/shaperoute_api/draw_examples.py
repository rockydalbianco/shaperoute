"""A city's examples drawn before anyone asks for them (ADR-0136).

The API keeps a city's examples once drawn (route_store.py): the first phone
in a city waits, the next do not. This command is that first phone, for a
list of cities: it asks a running API what the app asks when a city is
tapped, the city by name and then a circle, a heart and a star of 5 km from
its centre, one at a time, and waits for each. The circle goes first, as in
the app: its zone holds the other two (ADR-0144). The shapes the app draws
after those three are left to the first phone.

    python -m shaperoute_api.draw_examples --api http://127.0.0.1:8000 Rovereto
    python -m shaperoute_api.draw_examples --api https://... --preset italy

Run again, it goes through the cities already kept in a moment. The API's
key, when it asks for one, comes from SHAPEROUTE_API_KEY. A city whose zone
is not on the API's disk is downloaded by it, as for a phone: see
prefetch_zones.py for the zones of many cities at once.

With --water it is also the first phone on the water (TASK-246 part B): for
each point of the app's lists of lakes and beaches (water_spots.py) the
eight «Paddle» shapes a phone asks from it, at the point's distance, the
shapes in pieces with the pen up, as the app asks them. A point whose water
is not on the API's disk is skipped after its first shape, as the phone
does. --water-name only the points of a lake or beach.

    python -m shaperoute_api.draw_examples --api http://127.0.0.1:8000 --water
    python -m shaperoute_api.draw_examples --api ... --water-name "Lago di Levico"
