"""A shape through real places of a theme, in any city (TASK-129, ADR-0099).

POST /themed-route-jobs takes the words ("a romantic heart in Paris") and,
when the app knows it, the point of the city; the job reads the words
(themes.py), finds the places of the theme around the city, and plans the
shape through them (route_engine.stops). GET /themed-route-jobs/{id} says
how it went: the route, and every place found, passed by or not.

The places are OpenStreetMap's, through Geoapify's Places API with the key
of the place search (places.py): named ones only, those with a Wikidata
entry first. Nothing is invented: too few places, and the job says so.
