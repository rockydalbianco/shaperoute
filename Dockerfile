# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
# The ShapeRoute API with its route engine, for a server (TASK-081, ADR-0076).
# docs/DEPLOY.md, part C, says how to build it and start it.
#
#   docker build -t shaperoute-api .
#   docker run -d --name shaperoute -p 8000:8000 \
#     -e SHAPEROUTE_API_KEY=... -v shaperoute-cache:/app/data/cache \
#     --restart unless-stopped shaperoute-api
#
# Road graphs are downloaded the first time a zone is asked for, into the
# volume, and stay there across restarts and new images. The AI that reads
# shape words (Ollama) is not in the image: without it the API answers
# ai_unavailable to /shape-readings, and everything else works.
